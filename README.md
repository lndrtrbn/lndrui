# LNDRUI - Bank of UI components for React

Lndrui is a library of reusable components made in React for my personnal projects.

This library is made to be used in React applications.

## Storybook documentation

To see how the components look, clone this repository and launch the storybook server.

```
git clone https://github.com/lndrtrbn/lndrui.git
cd lndrui
npm i
npm run storybook
```

A local sotrybook app will launch with all components inside.

## Library usage

To use the library install it with npm using the ur of the repository.

```
npm i https://github.com/lndrtrbn/lndrui.git
```

The library will be added in your `node_modules`.

Then import the css file containing the styles of the components in the entry point of your application.

```
import "@lndrtrbn/lndrui/dist/index.css";
```
